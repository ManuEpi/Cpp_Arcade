## Code Generation

A Unix or Mac environment is neded for building GLEW from scratch to
include new extensions, or customize the code generation. The extension
data is regenerated from the top level source directory with:

	make extensions

An alternative to generating the GLEW sources from scratch is to
download a pre-generated (unsupported) snapshot:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/files/glew/snapshots/

Travis-built snapshots are also available:

## Authors

GLEW is currently maintained by [Nigel Stewart](https://github.com/nigels-com)
with bug fixes, new OpenGL extension support and new releases.

GLEW was developed by [Milan Ikits](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~ikits/)
and [Marcelo Magallon](http://wwwvis.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/~magallon/).
Aaron Lefohn, Joe Kniss, and Chris Wyman were the first users and also
assisted with the design and debugging process.  

The acronym GLEW originates from Aaron Lefohn.
Pasi K&auml;rkk&auml;inen identified and fixed several problems with
GLX and SDL.  Nate Robins created the `wglinfo` utility, to
which modifications were made by Michael Wimmer.
